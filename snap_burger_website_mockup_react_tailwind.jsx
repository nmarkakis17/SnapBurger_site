I've updated the website mockup to **include your SnapBurger assets** (Theo images, SnapCoins, merch, SnapBoard, signage, keychains, etc.) across multiple pages. This way, the site not only shows off your menu and ordering system but also the personality of Theo and your loyalty/branding system.

- Hero with animated SnapBurger logo (from Burger Logo).  
- Intro section with Outdoor View image showing signage.

Would you like me to build this out as a **real multi-page React site** with these images embedded so you can click between the pages, or just a visual mockup showing the layout with your uploaded assets placed in? This way you could either demo the design or immediately hand it to a developer.
